# Mood logger
Streamlit app to help track and visualize the vibes of patient support tickets for each day

The app allows user to select an mood, optionally add a note, and submit it. The app will then record the data in a Google Sheet. With each submission, the app will also update a bar graph with counts of the moods logged for today.
